#Problem 03 MO's Algorithm (Query Square Root Decomposition) | Set 1 (Introduction)
Last Updated : 02 May, 2025
Let us consider the following problem to understand MO's Algorithm.
We are given an array and a set of query ranges, we are required to find the sum of every query range.

Example: 

Input:  arr[]   = {1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 2, 8};
        query[] = [0, 4], [1, 3] [2, 4]
Output: Sum of arr[] elements in range [0, 4] is 8
        Sum of arr[] elements in range [1, 3] is 4  
        Sum of arr[] elements in range [2, 4] is 6


#Approach I used 
[Naive Solution] - Linearly Compute Sum for Every Query - O(mn) Time and O(1) Space
The idea s to run a loop from L to R and calculate the sum of elements in given range for every query [L, R]
